4683,OR,Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) and Fueling Infrastructure Tax Credit for Businesses,"Business owners and others may be eligible for a tax credit of 50% of
eligible costs for qualified alternative fuel infrastructure projects
through the [Business Energy Tax
Credit](https://www.oregon.gov/energy/Incentives/Pages/Transportation-Tax-Credits.aspx).
Fueling infrastructure for fuels such as propane and natural gas may
qualify for a tax credit of 35% of eligible costs. A tax credit of 35%
of eligible costs is also available for other qualified AFV projects.
The credit is filed over five years. Unused credits from a given year
can be carried forward up to eight years. For projects with eligible
costs of \$20,000 or less, the tax credit may be taken in one year.

An eligible applicant (a project owner) must meet the following
requirements:

-   Be a trade, business, or rental property owner with a business site
    in Oregon or be an Oregon non-profit organization, tribe, or public
    entity that partners with an Oregon business or resident;
-   Own or be the contract buyer of the project; and
-   Use the equipment or lease it to another person or business in
    Oregon.

Non-profit organizations and public entities that do not have an Oregon
tax liability may receive the credit for an eligible project but must
\""pass-through\"" or transfer their project eligibility to a pass-through
partner in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment. The Oregon Department
of Energy (ODOE) determines the rate that is used to calculate the cash
payment. The pass-through option is also available to a project owner
with an Oregon tax liability who chooses to transfer their tax credit.
ODOE must grant preliminary and final certification for a project to be
eligible. The taxpayer must have filed an application for the project
before April 15, 2011, and ODOE must have granted preliminary
certification for the project by July 1, 2011. Projects that began prior
to April 15, 2011, must receive final certification by July 1, 2014.

gasification facility that uses coal or biomass as a feedstock. KEDFA
also provides tax incentives for energy-efficient alternative fuel
production facilities and for up to five alternative fuel production
facilities that use natural gas or natural gas liquids as a feedstock.
Energy-efficient alternative fuels are defined as homogeneous fuels that
are produced from processes designed to densify feedstocks such as coal,
waste coal, or biomass resources and have an energy content that is
greater than the feedstock. The incentives may consist of: 1) a refund
of up to 100% of the state sales tax paid on the purchase of personal
property used to construct, retrofit, or upgrade the facility; 2) a
credit of up to 100% of an approved company\'s state income tax and
limited liability entity tax that the project generates; 3) up to 4% of
the wage assessment of employees whose jobs were created as a result of
the construction, retrofit, upgrade, or operation of a qualified
facility; and 4) a credit for up to 80% of the severance tax paid for
coal, natural gas, or natural gas liquids used as a feedstock. KEDFA may
allow advance incentive disbursement to encourage the use of in-state
labor for facility construction.

The incentives expire at the time of receipt of the authorized amount or
25 years from activation of the project, whichever occurs first.
Approved companies may recover up to 50% of their capital investment via
the authorized tax incentives. The minimum capital investment for
incentive eligibility is \$25 million for an alternative fuel or
gasification facility that uses biomass as the primary feedstock; \$100
million for an alternative fuel or gasification facility that uses coal,
oil shale, or tar sands as the primary feedstock; \$25 million for an
energy-efficient alternative fuel facility; and \$1 million for a
facility that uses natural gas or natural gas liquids as the primary
feedstock.

To apply for the incentive, an eligible taxpayer must submit a \$1,000
non-refundable application fee and remit payment for any other fees in
connection with the project, including administrative, legal, and
consulting fees. For more information, see the [Kentucky Business
Incentives and Financial
Programs](http://www.thinkkentucky.com/Locating_Expanding/Financial_Incentives.aspx)

the biofuel is not ethanol. Second generation biofuel is defined as
liquid fuel produced from any lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter
that is available on a renewable basis or any cultivated algae,
cyanobacteria, or lemna. To qualify, fuel must also meet the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency fuel and fuel additive registration
requirements. Alcohol with a proof of less than 150, fuel with a water
or sediment content of more than 4%, and fuel with an ash content of
more than 1% are not considered second generation biofuels. The

11662,CO,Inter-Agency Fleet Improvement Coordination,"The Colorado Energy Office, Department of Transportation (CDOT),
Department of Public Health and Environment, and Department of Personnel
and Administration (DPA) will establish a State Fleet Sub-Council
(Sub-Council) to help develop, implement, and improve programs, plans,
and policies that save money, reduce emissions, promote domestic fuel
use, and conserve natural resources. The Sub-Council will:

-   Develop standard procedures and formulas for modeling and monitoring
    potential alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and fuel reduction
    efforts that link acquisition and operations budgets;
-   Create an idle reduction policy for state agencies;
-   Create a process that allows fleet coordinators to replace vehicles
    with AFVs before standard retirement age if the replacement is
    cost-effective;
-   Identify and evaluate other fuel-saving practices and develop
    procedures for their implementation; and
-   Evaluate alternative financing options for state fleet vehicles
    including leasing, energy performance contracting, and other options
    that may reduce costs.

In addition, DPA and CDOT will establish policies and procedures to
promote the cost-effective use of non-petroleum fuel vehicles and other
fleet efficiency improvements. The policies must strive for the use of
non-petroleum based fuels at least 90% of the time when cost-effective.
